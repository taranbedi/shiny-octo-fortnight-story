There once was a majestic ruler who ruled all across India. Hi name was Bob although he didn't share a common indian name he was able to gain the respect of his people by his bravery and courage. One time bob even killed an elephant with his own bare hands. The people were amazed with his brute strength and decided to name bob the first white king of all of india.

One day, a year into Bob's majestic reign as king, a massive herd of elephents ravanged through his land, decimating fields of crops, plowing through villages and wreaking havoc. Bob, as king, set forth to turn back the parade of elephants. On an open field Bob stood alone before this stampeding herd and made his final effort to save his people.
